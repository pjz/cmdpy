The idea behind 'dopy' is to make it easy to make multi-command scripts by abstracting out all the dispatch machinery and commandline parsing.

dopy can be used either from the commandline:

  dopy mycmdpy command 

or as a #! line in a python script (mycmdpy above)

By default it thinks that all attributes that start with 'do_' are commands you want exposed.  The 'command prefix' is settable by setting a top-level variable named 'command_prefix' to whatever you want.

right now 'echopy' is the example program

TODO:

  * better example
  * some tests would be good
  * figure out how to delete mycmdpypyc that imp creates
